# open-match-demo
## Introduction

This tutorial aims to give you the tools to create your OpenMatch and use it with Arbitrium (Edgegap's solution). Like a wise man once said: "Keep it stupid simple." In this tutorial, we will not go in-depth about performances. This code will not be ready for production purposes. However, you should be able to create your production-ready Open Match!

## Objectives

At the end of this tutorial, you will have built 3 components (Director, Front End, Match function) that will run on a local Open Match environment. You will be able to create, get and delete tickets using HTTP requests. Your Matchmaker will match players together and automatically deploy servers on Arbitrium.
